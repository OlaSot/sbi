At that time, in the rapidly developing construction market, the newly established company started its activities in heating technology, plumbing, water supply, and sewage systems. It was one of the first in Lithuania to introduce modern heating equipment from Junkers, Viessman, and Buderus. During its development, the company built and renovated houses, installed internal and external sewage systems, and eventually began providing interior finishing services. Currently, since 2016, the revived company continues its operations in Hamburg, Germany.\nWe are deeply involved in the application of modern, advanced, and ecological materials and technologies in construction. As subcontractors, we participate in the construction of fast-built block and wooden houses. For interior finishing, as well as for kitchen and bathroom equipment, we use modern and natural materials made of stone, quartz, and ceramics.",
